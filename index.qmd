## What is R Markdown and why use it? {.smaller}

-   "Literate Programming"
    -   In 1962, grad student Donald Knuth was approached by a publisher
        to write a book on compiler (computer language) design. In
        response (watch for more scope creep), he proposed a 12-chapter
        book on computer programming. The project eventually balooned to
        a seven volume set called "The Art of Computer Programming",
        only four of which have been published to date (he's currently
        86). Knuth, who later became a CS professor at Stanford, found
        the typesetting tools completely (to him) inadequate to convey
        the math formulas in the books, so he suspended work to invent
        $\TeX$ (not unlike Newton inventing calculus to describe
        physics). Once he did that, he invented something called
        "literate programming" where code, output, and the text of an
        article or book could co-exist on the same document.

-   R
    -   In 1993, Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman wrote a statistical
        programming language that would be an update to the then-popular
        "S". They named it R not only to promote it as a successor to S,
        but because it was the first letter of each of their names.

-   Markup Languages
    -   Since the early 1960s, so-called "markup" languages have been
        developed and used to add structure and control appearance of
        plain text documents. Among them are HyperText Markup Language
        (HTML), $\TeX$/$\LaTeX$, and Yet Another Markup Language (YAML).
    -   R-Markdown is both a pun (marking down instead of up) and a
        promotion of it being a next-generation mark(up\|down) language.

## What needs to be in place to use it to generate MS-Word documents? {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
On a fresh or fully-functional installation of R and R Studio which has
never created an R Markdown document, the user will be prompted to
approve installation of several packages the first time they create an R
Markdown document.

## The structure of an R Markdown document

YAML header -- You'll may add more here over time

```         
---
title: "My Sample Markdown Document"
author: "Eeyore Namehere"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output: word_document
---
```

Setup block and snippet flags

![](./images/setupSnippet.png)

After the YAML and the setup block, you can put an arbitrary amount of
markup around R (or other languages, but that's "beyond the scope"
snippets.

## Visual and source editor modes

Markdown

## blocks of R code with "**code snippets**"

Improved table display with Kable

## "knitting" your document to HTML or MS-Word.

Checking your work incrementally by knitting to HTML

## Formula notation

Formulas are given as $\LaTeX$ between two dollar signs thus:

```         
$\hat{y}=\beta_0+\beta_1x+\epsilon$
```

yields

$\hat{y}=\beta_0+\beta_1x+\epsilon$

By the way,

```         
$\LaTeX$
```

yields

$\LaTeX$

## Tables of contents

## Citations

Using citations and references Citations using DOIs, BibTex format, or
integration with Zotero

## Cross-Referencing Figures and Tables

Using cross-references with Figures and Tables

## Using a wordcount plugin to R Studio for word counts

Using the Wordcount add-in to R Studio for tracking word count and
readability.

## Fine-tuning your MS-Word document

Fine-tuning your resulting MS-Word document by adjusting the built-in
style sheets.
