## What is R Markdown and why use it? {.smaller}

-   "Literate Programming"
    -   In 1962, grad student Donald Knuth was approached by a publisher
        to write a book on compiler (computer language) design. In
        response (watch for more scope creep), he proposed a 12-chapter
        book on computer programming. The project eventually balooned to
        a seven volume set called "The Art of Computer Programming",
        only four of which have been published to date (he's currently
        86). Knuth, who later became a CS professor at Stanford, found
        the typesetting tools completely (to him) inadequate to convey
        the math formulas in the books, so he suspended work to invent
        $\TeX$ (not unlike Newton inventing calculus to describe
        physics). Once he did that, he invented something called
        "literate programming" where code, output, and the text of an
        article or book could co-exist on the same document.

## What is R Markdown and why use it? {.smaller}

-   R
    -   In 1993, Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman wrote a statistical
        programming language that would be an update to the then-popular
        "S". They named it R not only to promote it as a successor to S,
        but because it was the first letter of each of their names.

## What is R Markdown and why use it? {.smaller}

-   Markup Languages
    -   Since the early 1960s, so-called "markup" languages have been
        developed and used to add structure and control appearance of
        plain text documents. Among them are HyperText Markup Language
        (HTML), $\TeX$/$\LaTeX$, and Yet Another Markup Language (YAML).
    -   R-Markdown is both a pun (marking down instead of up) and a
        promotion of it being a next-generation mark(up\|down) language.

## What needs to be in place to use R Studio to generate MS-Word documents? {.smaller .center}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
On a fresh or fully-functional installation of R and R Studio which has
never created an R Markdown document, the user will be prompted to
approve installation of several packages the first time they create an R
Markdown document.

## The structure of an R Markdown document {.smaller}

-   At the very top of your `R markdown` document:
    -   YAML header (`Y`et `A`nother `M`arkdown `L`anguage)
        -   You may add more to it over time
        -   Start and end with a line of three dashes
        -   Blank line after the closing three dashes

:::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
```         
---
title: "My Sample Markdown Document"
author: "Eeyore Namehere"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`" #<1>
output: word_document #<2>
---
```

1.  This construction will give you a dynamic date each time you `knit`
    your document.
2.  Usually, this will be `word_document` or `html_document`

## The structure of an R Markdown document {.smaller}

**Setup block and code chunk flags**

The setup block is typically the first `r code chunk` in an
`r markdown document`.

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
![](./images/setupSnippet.png)
:::

:::: {.column width="40%"}
::: callout-note
## What is a `code chunk`?

A `code chunk` is a block of executable code that begins and ends with a
line of three backticks (\`\`\`). The first line of backticks ends with
braces which indicate the language for the chunk (typically r ), a name
for the code chunk, and however many options you care to set. Between
the first and last lines is executable R code.
:::
::::
::::::

After the YAML and the setup block, you can put an arbitrary amount of
markup and R code chunks.

## Visual and source editor modes {.smaller}

## "knitting" your document to HTML or MS-Word.

This button ![](./images/knit.png) will will turn your R Markdown into
whatever output you've chosen. Usually, this will be `word_document` or
`html_document`.

Remember the YAML header:

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```         
---
title: "My Sample Markdown Document"
author: "Eeyore Namehere"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output: word_document
---
```
:::
::::

## Formula notation 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="15%"}
:::

::: {.column width="*"}
Formulas are given as $\LaTeX$ between two dollar signs thus:

```
$\hat{y}=\beta_0+\beta_1x+\epsilon$
```

yields

$\hat{y}=\beta_0+\beta_1x+\epsilon$

By the way,

```         
$\LaTeX$
```

yields

$\LaTeX$
:::
:::::

## Tables of contents

If you modify your YAML header like this...

```         
---
title: "My Sample Markdown Document"
author: "Eeyore Namehere"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output: 
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
---
```

## Tables of contents

...you will get a Table of Contents something like this at the top of
your document. If your output target is `word_document`, it will be
slightly more elaborate.

The TOC is constructed from all the lines using header style (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.)

:::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](./images/htmlTOC.png)
:::
::::

## Citations {.smaller}

To use citations and automatically generate a Works Cited at the end of
the document, you can change your YAML like this. This isn't the only
approach, but this is what I've used.^[I need to update this to Chicago citation format to be consistent with Professor Rocca's Craft of Policy course]

```         
---
title: "My Sample Markdown Document"
author: "Eeyore Namehere"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output:
  bookdown::html_document2: default
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

Note that I've added a new section `header-includes:` and in it, I've
told knit to load the $\LaTeX$ package `apacite` for APA citations, and
told it to use APA bibliographic style. I've also added a section
`bibliography:` to tell it what file has my references, in Bibtex
format.

## Citations

Citations can be added by nesting it in a construction like `[@blah]` .

```         
Here is some text in which I will cite references, such as [@olson2020] or perhaps @bowser2006 or a particular page of [@aragon2020, Page 34-55] or cite a DOI [@hodgson2006]
```

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](./images/insertingFromDOI.png){fig-align="left"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
Citations that aren't in a bibliography file can be added with the DOI,
but that requires using the editor in visual mode, and choosing
Insert/Citation/From DOI.
:::
:::::

## Citations

Once you knit your document, you should see your citations and reference
list show up something like this. You will probably want to put a
`# Works cited` or equivalent at the bottom of your document so it will
be immediately before the reference list.

![](./images/renderedCites.png){fig-align="left" width="100%"}

## Cross-references{.smaller}

- In your paper, if you want to have references in your text to specific tables or figures elsewhere in your document rather than just "in the figure above", you'll need to know how to do cross-references.
- Plain vanilla R Markdown can't do internal cross-references. To do that, we'll have to install the `bookdown` package.
- After Bookdown is installed, you'll have to modify your `YAML` header to use it.
- Cross-referencing will be explained.

## Cross-references{.smaller}
#### Installing the Bookdown package

From your R Studio console, issue the command<br>
`install.packages("bookdown")`<br>


::::columns

:::{.column width="60%"}

![](./images/bookdownInstall.png)

:::

:::{.column width="40%"}

R Studio will complain if you don't have the packages installed to compile new packages from source, but if you're on a Mac or Windows machine, it shouldn't be necessary to have them.

:::

::::

## Cross-references{.smaller}
#### Changing your YAML header for Bookdown
To use `bookdown`, you need to change your document's `YAML` header.
Here's an example of one that works.  This is to knit to an HTML document with the output target of `bookdown::html_document2`, but to knit to an MS-Word document, use `bookdown::word_document2` instead.

:::: columns
:::{.column width="60%"}
![](./images/yamlWithBookdown.png)
:::
:::: 

## Cross-references{.smaller}
#### figure cross-references
Names and cross-references to figures are typically used in both the caption to the figure and a cross-reference to a figure in the document text.

- define a reference in a figure code chunk

::::columns
:::{.column width="90%"}

` ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Temp v. Pressure'} `<br>
` plot(pressure) `<br>
` ``` `<br>
The label "pressure" is the name used for the figure. "Temp v. Pressure" is the text used in the caption.

- To refer to the figure in your text, use the label like this: `\@ref(fig:pressure)`

:::{.column width="50%"}

#### figure cross-references
...would be rendered like this.

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

![](./images/figReferenceRendered.png)

:::

## Cross-references{.smaller}
#### table cross-references
- Table cross-references are a little different.  Within a code chunk, you need to render your table using `knitr::kable` something like this, so you can give it a caption:<p>

` ```{r cars, echo=FALSE} `<br>
` knitr::kable( ` <br>
`   summary(cars), ` <br>
`   caption = "This is the summary of the cars table", ` <br>
`   booktabs = TRUE ` <br>
` ) ` <br>
` ```  ` <br>
- The cross-references for tables, though, are essentially the same:<p>
` \@ref(tab:cars)`

## Cross-references{.smaller}

:::{.column width="30%"}

The source for labeling, captioning, and cross-referencing a table would be something like this...
