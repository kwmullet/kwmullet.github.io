    "text": "What is R Markdown and why use it?\n\n“Literate Programming”\n\nIn 1962, grad student Donald Knuth was approached by a publisher to write a book on compiler (computer language) design. In response (watch for more scope creep), he proposed a 12-chapter book on computer programming. The project eventually balooned to a seven volume set called “The Art of Computer Programming”, only four of which have been published to date (he’s currently 86). Knuth, who later became a CS professor at Stanford, found the typesetting tools completely (to him) inadequate to convey the math formulas in the books, so he suspended work to invent \\(\\TeX\\) (not unlike Newton inventing calculus to describe physics). Once he did that, he invented something called “literate programming” where code, output, and the text of an article or book could co-exist on the same document."
